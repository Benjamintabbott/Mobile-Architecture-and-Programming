    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    
    The requirements for the Inventory app that I created was to create a database with at least two tables. One to store the usernames and passwords and another to store the items and their quantities. I was requred to make a login screen, as well as a screen to display all the items in the inventory. I needed to make a mechanism to add remove and adjust the amount of items in the inventory. 
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    
    I needed to make multiple screens to support the user needs. There is a login screen, a create account screen, a screen to display the inventory list and a screen to edit or add items. These four screens helped create a user-centered UI for the inventory app through easy to navigate and simple yet intuitive design. I believe that my designs were successful and visually appealing. 
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    
    I approached designing the app by separating the project into different tasks. The first task was to create the login database. When that was complete I began coding the login screen that would connect to said database. Next I coded the create account screen allowing the two of them to switch between eachother. When that task was coded, tested, and functional I moved on to the inventory database. After that database was complete I started to code the logic behind inventory display and the input screen. I tested this and then connected the login setup to the inventory app to bring it all together. 
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    
    I tested my code to make sure it was functional by running the app. I switched the starting activity to have the screen I was working on be the starting activity. After each activity worked as planned. I then connected them one at a time and ran them to make sure they all worked together as planned.
    
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    
    There were multiple roadblocks that I ran into while developing this app. In some cases I had to redesign the UI to make it work as needed. I also had multiple times where I had to find out how to get different functions to work. I used YouTube to help find similar problems and this helped me overcome these challenges. 
    
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
    
    I believe that the inventory card display screen that I created was particularly successful. I find it visually appealing and it displays the data in a sophisticated way and it allows for editing through buttons that appear when the each card is clicked.
